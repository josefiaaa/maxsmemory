                        As Max was developing his musical skill, he wanted to invest in better equipment to reflect his talent. He worked hard to save up money for a pearl coated Fender Stratocaster, a beautiful guitar to complement his remarkable music. Max's family has established this foundation is his name to spread the love and joy Max felt while playing and composing music. By contributing, you will support young aspiring musicians with improved equipment, scholarships and or educational grants who may not have the opportunity that Max did.

                        While Max was already a hard working and commited individual, he craved more dicipline and structure.  Your donation to the Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society will help to provide financial assistance to Sailors, Marines and their families in times of need.
