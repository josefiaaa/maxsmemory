                I was blessed to be able to watch Max grow from a teenager, to a fine young man. Maxwell, your presence will

                Just us, the road, and some tunes. Sharing our musical influences, and how they impacted our lives 
                and were expressed in our musicianship, was special to me. Thank you for being part of my 
                life, you will be missed Max."</i> - Albert Seaman (Friend)

                without even trying and he always put your feelings first before his own. He was the sweetest human I have ever 
                met. He would visit me at work when he was home before December and he would just light up about how I was doing 
                and he would use these big fancy words to describe his experience and places he has been while over seas. He was 
                so driven and so passionate about anything he was set to do. He will be missed so much, and he will 
                never be forgotten."</i> - Delaney Cook (Friend)
